## Issues
Before **creating** an Issue for a feature, bugs or improvements, please follow these steps:

1. search existing Issues before creating a new issue (has someone raised this already)
2. if it doesn't exist create a new issue giving as much context as possible.


### Working on an Issue (get it assigned to you)

**Before working** on an Issue, please follow these steps:

1. only ask to be assigned 1 **open** issue at a time.
2. comment asking for the issue to be assigned to you (do not tag maintainers on GitHub or Discord, be patient!)
3. **only** start working on this Issue when it has been assigned to you. This prevents duplication of or wasted effort. 
4. reference the Issue in your Pull Request (for example `closes #002`)
5. please do **not** force push to your PR branch.

> Notes:
>
> - check the `Assignees` box at the top of an issue page to see if the issue has been assigned to someone else before requesting this be assigned to you
> - if an Issue is unclear, ask questions to get more clarity before asking to have the Issue assigned to you
> - only request to be assigned an Issue if you know how to work on it
> - any Issues that have no activity, or progress updates showing reasonable progress after 2 weeks will be unassigned and re-assigned to someone else.

## Reviewing Pull Requests (PRs)

We welcome everyone to review Pull Requests, it is a great way to learn, network and support each other.

### Good PR review practices

- be kind and respectful, refer to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- use inline comments to explain your suggestions
- use inline suggestions to propose changes

### Bar PR Review practices

- do not be rude, disrespectful or aggressive etc.
- do not repeat feedback that has already been given (check the existing conversation), use GitHub reactions if you agree/disagree with a comment.
- do not blindly approve pull requests to improve your GitHub contributors graph, this will result in removal of review privileges.
