## Covenant Code of Conduct
Our code of conduct can be simplified to 5 words: "be nice to each other".

Maintainers have the final say in any potential breaches of this code of conduct, but will always act as fairly and impartially as possible, taking into account intent as well as results or any violations.

You can contact GrahamTheDev via [email at graham@grahamthe.dev](mailto:graham@grahamthe.dev), or via DM on [Graham's Twitter profile: @GrahamTheDev](https://x.com/GrahamTheDev) if you wish to raise a concern or complaint related to breaches of this Code of Conduct. 

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders and maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

In majority of cases we will operate a "three strikes" policy on accidental transgressions. For any transgressions that are deem deliberate, however, we will implement and permanent and life time ban.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces (This repository, Live Streams and other related events.). 

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. 

This is currently GrahamTheDev, who can be contacted via [email at graham@grahamthe.dev](mailto:graham@grahamthe.dev), or via DM on [Graham's Twitter profile: @GrahamTheDev](https://x.com/GrahamTheDev). 

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and as fairly as possible.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct, where it was deemed that the action / outcome was unintentional / through being misguided or ill-informed:

### 1. Correction (first offence)
A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning (second offence)
A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban (third offence)
A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban (fourth offence)
A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community. This includes related accounts and attempts to bypass the ban with new accounts.

### Instant Ban
If anyone is deemed to be deliberately hateful, harmful, racist, bigoted or in any way causing *deliberate* harm, they will receive an instant ban. The previous 4 steps are for non-intentional violations of the code of conduct.
